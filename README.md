## 📖 Overview

A simple and functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
This is my first web development project, created to practice core JavaScript logic and frontend fundamentals.

## ✨ Features

-   🎯 **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-   🔢 **Number Input**: Allows input of single or multi-digit numbers and decimals.
-   🔙 **Clear Functionality (AC)**: Resets the calculator display and state.
-   🗑️ **Delete Functionality (DEL)**: Removes the last entered digit.
-   📱 **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes (implied by typical CSS best practices, though not explicitly confirmed as fully responsive without deeper CSS analysis).
